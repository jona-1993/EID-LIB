 
## Belgian electronic identity card library (.NET Standard)

Dependencies:

- Middleware EID: https://eid.belgium.be/fr

Works with:
- Windows (32 bits)
- Mac (64 bits)
- Linux (64 bits)

If you would have a build for Windows, you need to build EID-Lib with Windows. (Because I use a preprocessor directive for use 32 bits long types)
